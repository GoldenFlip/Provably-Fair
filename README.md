## 🔒 What Makes It Provably Fair?

GoldenFlip employs a cryptographic approach to ensure fairness in every coin flip. The fairness mechanism is based on the following:

### Randomness Generation
Each coin flip result is generated using the combination of the following inputs:

1. **Player Seed**: A random string provided by the player before the flip. This ensures that players can influence the randomness.
2. **Server Seed**: A cryptographic hash (SHA256) generated by the server. The server reveals the seed **after** the flip to prevent tampering.
3. **Round ID**: A unique identifier for each flip session to ensure no two flips use the same input combination.

### Formula
The flip result is determined by the following:

```
result = SHA256(playerSeed + serverSeed + roundID) % 2
```

- The SHA256 hash ensures secure and unpredictable randomness.
- The modulo operation (`% 2`) ensures a binary result: `0` for heads and `1` for tails.

### Verification
After each flip:
- The server reveals the `serverSeed` used in the calculation.
- Players can use the `playerSeed`, `serverSeed`, and `roundID` to recompute the hash and verify the result.

This system guarantees that the game cannot cheat and that the result is unbiased.

## 📜 Step-by-Step Guide to Verification

1. **Retrieve Data**:
   - Get the `playerSeed` you provided before the flip.
   - Get the `serverSeed` revealed after the flip.
   - Note the `roundID` shown in your game history.

2. **Recompute the Hash**:
   Use a SHA256 hash function to combine the inputs:

   ```
   hash = SHA256(playerSeed + serverSeed + roundID)
   ```

3. **Determine the Result**:
   Compute the flip result:

   ```
   result = hash % 2
   ```

   - `0` corresponds to **Heads**
   - `1` corresponds to **Tails**

4. **Match the Result**:
   Compare your computed result with the game outcome. If they match, the result is verified!
